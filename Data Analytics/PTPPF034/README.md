In order to complete this challenge, you will have to create an external Cloud Storage table in BigQuery, load data from Cloud Storage into BigQuery, create a stored procedure to merge data, ingest data using BigQuery subscriptions, and finally, correct an issue with a Java application that is using the BigQuery Storage Write API; this will be done using a configuration that is not suitable for the demonstration.
